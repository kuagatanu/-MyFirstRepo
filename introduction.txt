My name is Ishimwe Anne Kelia. I am a passionate learner currently enrolled in ALX, focusing on data science and computing.

I enjoy applying my skills to real-world problems, especially in data, business, and community development. I have experience as a volunteer and data collector and look forward to building more with Git and GitHub.
